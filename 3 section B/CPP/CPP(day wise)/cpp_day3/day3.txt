Namespace
-used to avoid name ambiguity in case of globle variable,function,classes
-Logical grouping of variable , function, enum, structure, class, namespaces.
-to achive logical modularity















cout - object of ostream class declared in iostream inside std namespace
	It uses << operator called as insertion operator

	It uses >> operator called as extraction operator

Memory leakage - some memory is dynamically allocated and no pointer is available to access that memory; such type of wastage of memory is called Memory leakage.



Dangling pointer- a pointer which is points to "unallocated memory" is called as dangling pointer. 







References-A reference variable is an alias that is , another name for an already existing variable.














call by value
call by address
call by referance
